## Example

Setup: Solving a long division problem

* See long division problem (10000 divided by 37)
 * LVC: sight > "Long division problem"
 * LVC: sight > Slot1: number, Slot2: number
  * LVC: (Slot1, what?) > "37"
  * LVC: (Slot2, what?) > "10000"
* S1: ("Long division problem", what can I do?) > "Solve it"
  * WM: (Goal: "Solve it") >
* S1: ("Long division problem", "Solve it") > (step 1: find smallest number on right larger than number on left)
  * WM: (Sub-goal: "Find smallest number on right larger than number on left") >
* S1: ("Find smallest number larger than another number", how?) > procedure: step 1: compare same number of digits
  * WM: (sub-goal: compare same number of digits)
* S1: (37, number of digits?) > 2
  * S1: (10000, 2 digits) > 10
    * WM: (tempR: 10) >
* WM: Slot1 > 37
  * S1: (10, 37, greater than?) > no
* S1: ("Find smallest number larger than another number", step 2, no) > choose one more digit
  * S1: (10000, 10, one more digit?) > 100
* S1: (100, 37, greater than?) > yes
  * ??: "Continue/end"
* WM: (tempR: 100)
