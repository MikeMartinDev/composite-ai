## Example

Setup: Solving a long division problem

* See long division problem (10000 divided by 37)
 * LVC: sight > "Long division problem"
 * LVC: sight > Slot1: number, Slot2: number
  * LVC: (Slot1, what?) > "37"
  * LVC: (Slot2, what?) > "10000"
* S1: ("Long division problem", what can I do?) > "Solve it"
* WM: (Goal: "Solve it")
* S1: ("Long division problem", "Solve it") > (step 1: find smallest number on right larger than number on left)
* WM: (Sub-goal: "Find smallest number on right larger than number on left")
* S1: ()
